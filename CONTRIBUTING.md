### Adding a new language

If you want to add a new language, you have multiple options:

1. Create a pull request on GitHub that adds the new translations in the `Guard.WPF/Resources` folder. Don't worry if you don't know how to integrate the translations into the application code.
2. Contact me and ask me to add a new language to the [Crowdin project](https://translate.2faguard.app). This allows you to use a comfortable web interface to translate the app.
3. Send me the translation file via email to [info@2faguard.app](mailto:info@2faguard.app).

### Improve existing translations

If you want to improve existing translations, please register for a free account on [Crowdin](https://translate.2faguard.app) and start suggesting new translations or improving existing ones.
